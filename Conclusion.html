<center> <h3> In conclusion, vaccinations are important to both our individual and societal health. Whereas minimal distinct risks do exist for certain vaccination products and moral concerns may be raised, 
I believe that careful and thoughtful evaluation of such matters leads to the conclusion that vaccination programs are not only acceptable, but should be strongly encouraged.  If you are still 
now sure of your decision regarding vaccination, consider reading some of these studies and papers written by experts. </h3> </center>
